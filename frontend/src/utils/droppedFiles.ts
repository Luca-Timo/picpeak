/**
 * Files from a drop, with dropped folders walked recursively.
 *
 * `dataTransfer.files` lists a dropped folder as one zero-byte entry, so the
 * uploader has to go through `dataTransfer.items` and the FileSystem entry
 * API to reach the files inside. Browsers without `webkitGetAsEntry` keep
 * the plain `files` list.
 *
 * `collectDroppedEntries` keeps each file's directory relative to the drop
 * (issue 1786): `shoot/Friday` for `shoot/Friday/IMG_1.jpg` when the folder
 * `shoot` was dropped, '' for a loose file. That is `entry.fullPath` without
 * the leading slash and the file name, built from the names on the way down
 * so it does not depend on how a browser fills fullPath. The upload maps
 * those directories to gallery folders; `collectDroppedFiles` is the flat
 * list for callers that do not care.
 *
 * Inside a folder the entries are sorted by
 * name (`readEntries` hands them back in batches of unspecified order) and
 * hidden entries (`.DS_Store`, `._IMG_0001.jpg`) are skipped. The dropped
 * items themselves are taken as the user chose them.
 *
 * `limit` stops the walk once that many files are collected, so a drop of a
 * whole archive is not turned into File objects before the uploader's cap
 * truncates the result. It is a ceiling for the walk, not the cap: pass a
 * value that does not depend on the selection at drop time, since that can
 * change while the walk is pending. Only files passing `accept` are
 * collected and counted, so sidecars and oversized files inside the folder
 * do not use up the budget. It is told how deep the file sits: depth 0 is an
 * item the user dropped by hand, anything above it was found inside a folder,
 * which is the difference between a rejection worth naming and one that is
 * just noise.
 *
 * A directory's entry list is always drained and sorted as a whole — names
 * only, which is cheap — because `readEntries` batches come in unspecified
 * order and stopping between them could drop a name that sorts first. What
 * the limit bounds is the expensive part: resolving `entry.file()` and
 * recursing into subfolders, both done in sorted order until it is reached.
 * Plain files (no entry API) are returned unfiltered; the caller filters.
 *
 * Rejected files do not count toward `limit`, so a tree of nothing but
 * unsupported files would still resolve every one of them. A second budget
 * bounds the files examined: EXAMINED_PER_COLLECTED times the limit, enough
 * for RAW + sidecar + JPEG sets several times over. The walk stops when
 * either budget is spent. When it is the examined budget that ends the walk
 * with entries still unread, `onTruncated` is called once, so the caller can
 * say so instead of omitting files silently (running into `limit` is the
 * caller's own cap and has its own notice).
